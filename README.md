# Resal

A simple game where you try to shoot targets. I made this while on a plane so it was mostly a way to kill time, 
but I *do* think this could be a fun game if I polish it up

## How to play

The only control is the space bar. When the ship is moving, press space bar to stop it. You want 
to stop the ship when you think it is in line with the target. Once you stop the ship, you will see a 
red meter next to it. Press space again to fire. Your goal is to fire when the meter is full. The 
more full the meter is when you fire, the bigger the laser will be. If you get very close to firing 
with a full meter, the laser will be extra big, giving you a better chance at hitting your target.

## Unfinished business

- [ ] show a help menu in the game to explain how to play
- [ ] game over screen - I didn't get to this on the flights, but when your lives keep decrementing forever, so you never lose at the moment
- [ ] power ups
- [ ] make it play nicely on mobile? (idk if I feel like doing this)
